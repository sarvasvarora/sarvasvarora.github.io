Games are fun, no doubt. But what's even more fun is to code them!  
\
While learning Javascript, I felt that the fun stuff lies in projects that can be interacted with, and games were a no-brainer to build. Here are the few that I recreated.

## Simon
Yes, it's the OG Simon game, which probably led us all to bang our head remembering all those permutations of the colors.

The github repo for this can be found [here](https://github.com/sarvasvarora/simon-game) and the game can be played [here](https://sarvasvarora.me/simon-game).

## Snake Game
This was one of my favorites when I used to have one of those Nokia keypad phones, and no wonder I implemented this.

## Hangman
This one is coded in Python, and has a command line interface. [Here's](https://github.com/sarvasvarora/Hangman-Game) the repo.
