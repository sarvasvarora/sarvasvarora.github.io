This application uses the [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org) API to fetch the current temperature, associated weather condition infographic, and the weather condition based on user's current location. It also changes the background according to the temperature to give an actual vibe of it :p  
\
The github repo is available [here](https://github.com/sarvasvarora/weather-webapp) and the app can be accessed at [sarvasvarora.me/weather-webapp](https://sarvasvarora.me/weather-webapp).
