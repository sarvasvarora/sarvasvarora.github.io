Today was a long day. I had an afternoon picnic with my friends. Everyone was excited to meet each other after a long-drawn summer and we chatted for hours. Now I am sitting by the Lachine Canal with my bike parked alongside me. The weather is pleasant. A bit windy for my taste, but pleasant regardless.  
\
Several people are sitting on the pier across me, some even brought portable chairs with them. Some are relaxing on the grass, while some are taking a stroll by the water. I wonder what’s going on in their minds. Are they looking forward to a nice Sunday brunch, or reminiscing their best friend’s shenanigans from Friday night’s party? Are they still worrying about the upcom- ing deadline their boss has been on their toes with them, or maybe they are observing me back, ha!  
\
Across the pier, I see two people kayaking. A man is racing with a woman, who I assume is his girlfriend. They’re locked in a heated competition, and there’s something rather sweet about that. The kayaks look like lovebirds to me, flying together in the sea of air without a worry about this world. I have never kayaked before but I most definitely will try it out this semester. Part of me wants to go up to them and ask where they rented the kayaks from, but I realize that I can’t fly out to reach them.

As my gaze was slowly moving rightwards following this couple, my eyes brushed past a woman walking her cute, fluffy dog (I think it is a Pomeranian) that instantly reminded me of my adorable cat. Oh how much I love her! She’s just 4 months old but has a very brave personality for a cat that young. She takes her time exploring any new environment she’s put in, and is very calm and affectionate around new people. I will most definitely bring her to this spot sometime in the future. I bet she would love loafing on the grass beside me.

And as I continue to mesmerize this moment, the sky gradually reflects majestic shades of purple. I ready myself for a satisfying sunset and get back to biking from my extended water break.
