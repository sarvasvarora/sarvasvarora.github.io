I ran afar from dawn’s murky glance  
To be found by sun’s encompassing providence.  
Sitting on a bench by a cobblestone road,  
Observing the infinite pattern formed by their intersecting edges.  
Pondering...  
What true happiness really is.  
\
Watching a parade of leaves dancing to the tune of wind  
That slyly tickles past my face,  
Listening to the ever steadfast steam clock  
Performing its melodious symphony,  
And wishing that someday I might join the birds in their escapade.  
But the most joyous of them all:  
I write this little poem of vivid perceptions.  
\
And yet I reckon  
That it’s just half done, without a closure.  
And that I have to write more to be truly happy.  
Because a man’s virtues are but balanced by his sins  
For I am a little greedy, no doubt.

I was strolling around Water St. in Gastown, Vancouver one morning and found some cozy benches to rest on. As I sipped my coffee and looked around, the street bustling with lively tourists and locals alike, I decided to write this short poem.
