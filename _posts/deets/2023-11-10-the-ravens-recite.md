Through the lands forsaken, Huginn[^1] takes flight  
Not knowing the names of the requiem flowers;  
Above the emerald fields[^2], Muninn[^3] soars in golden light.  
\
Through the shadows cast by human spite,  
In search for endless power.  
Through the lands forsaken, Huginn takes flight.  
\
Above the canvas where colors unite,  
Solidarity and freedom they empower.  
Above the emerald fields, Muninn soars in golden light.  
\
Through the conqueror’s legacy, left behind as mortal plight;  
Whispers of triumph and sorrow, trying to silence the howler.  
Through the lands forsaken, Huginn takes flight.  
\
Above the canopy of candles divine, shimmering with hope ignite;  
Embraced with love, its wings bathe with benevolent showers.  
Above the emerald fields, Muninn soars in golden light.  
\
Omniscient, they recite, thoughts and memories through the tranquil night;  
Half a gift of life, and half in death[^4] — to their one-eyed father[^5].  
Through the lands forsaken, Huginn takes flight;  
Above the emerald fields, Muninn soars in golden light.  


[^1]: Huginn (old Norse: “thought”) is one of Odin’s ravens who fly over the world and bring back information.
[^2]: Valhalla, the pristine heavenly land, is often depicted with lush greenery.
[^3]: Muninn (old Norse: “memory” or “mind”) is Huginn’s companion.
[^4]: Thoughts exist when one lives, memories persist post one’s death. Thoughts and memories reference Huginn and Muninn.
[^5]: Odin (Old Norse: Óðinn) is referred to as the one-eyed father.

This poem portrays the duality of our world, consisting of both good and evil, through the perspective of a pair of mythical ravens. The poem touches themes of human thought, conquest for power, freedom, love, and the cyclical nature of life and death. The poem is written as a villanelle, which due to its alternating structure, is very effective for depicting contrasting themes and blending them into one at the end.
