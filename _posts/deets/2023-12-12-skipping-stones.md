The stone gracefully treads over the river,  
Showing the world it’s beautiful ballet.  
The tune of the ripples — eternally angelic,  
Points to the stone, asking me if that is freedom   
\
I reply “Indeed, for what else could it be?  
To shape its own course, unfettered as a bird released from its chains;  
Tipping you into existence, making everyone hear your delightful tune;  
And dancing to it like a playful dragon.”  
\
But enraged, the ripples revolt;  
Offering it a taste of the river’s intoxicating elixir.  
And then drowns the stone, gullible enough;  
Only to be replaced by another one I throw.
