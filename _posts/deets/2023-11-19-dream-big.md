In the delicate balance of rhymes,  
Words find meaning.  
Whispers of thoughts confined,  
Leave my soul redeeming.  
But amidst the cacophony of life, I am but a mime;  
Or so I am scheming.  
To write a poem so sublime,  
For you to glean in.

I have always enjoyed reading poetry and admired it as an art that converts the *usual* into something more profound and beautiful. This admiration, with an innate urge to see myself holding the pen and inking down a beautiful image of words, eventually led me to try creative writing.  
\
I write poems to express my emotions, and beyond just being a creative outlet, it enables me to stay open to new experiences and knowledge. It is therapeutic, helping me make sense of life's complexities, and serving as a constant reminder that we are not alone in our feelings and struggles.  
\
I want my poetry to be accessible and widely read. I hope that my words resonate with people, creating a shared experience through the ups and downs of life. I also aim to write on niche subjects and cultures that are usually unheard of, not getting the attention they deserve.
