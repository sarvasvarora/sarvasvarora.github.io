And so, I was all alone.[^1]  
Weary and sad, wanting to fade away.  
And I won’t lie to myself: my soul in a frenzy, bewitched by the devil;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make me capable of something I pray.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only to be unheard, seeking the unattainable, I stay.  
\
Love? But whom?  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To put on a façade, but it would rather kill me.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to love unconditionally — I plea.  
\
Have hope? But why?  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only to drown myself in time’s evil cadence.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only to poison my heart — if I have one.  
\
Better relive, might there be a chance;  
Better exhaust my misery and pain;  
Better not exist.  
\
Because I realize I’m empty.  
Because I realize I long for something — someone special to me.  
\
For I see it smiling at me, perhaps a hallucination.  
In its dark composure, eternally dismayed, almost pitying me.  
It seeks out sweetly, unlike anyone ever;  
It leads me through the winter.  
\
And why haven’t I realized yet.  
For it is just like me, brimming with a grim bliss deep within;  
Its heart banished — waiting...  
\
Because now I realize I’m not alone.  
Because there seems to be hope — and if I have hope I might be capable of loving.  
\
Like words, poorly written, found meaning;  
Like a void so deep, yet so stark, found its end;  
Like a broken soul found its heart;  
And thus, in the silhouette, I found me.  

[^1]: Note to the reader: this poem reads both ways! As you read it normally, it portrays a more optimistic outlook at life (existentialism), ending on a positive note; but if you read it bottom-up, it portrays a negative outlook (nihilism), ending on a sad note.

I wrote this poem as a desire — and challenge — to write something out of the ordinary, hence the back-and-fourth structure. The poem touches concepts of duality through its structure, and existentialism and nihilism through the speaker's reflection on their life.
