In your laughter, friendship blooms,  
A dance of souls in fleeting rooms;  
Love’s whisper in your softest gaze,  
In your presence, my heart ablaze.  
\
Yet loving you, in time unripe,  
Casts a shadow, my heart in strife;  
An unfinished poem; a confession remains,  
In your absence, all in vain.  
\
For it’s not pain nor sorrow that makes me cry;  
It’s love. It’s kindness. A chance gone by.
