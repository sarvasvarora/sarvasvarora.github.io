### How do I even pronounce your name?
Aha! I get this question a lot, especially by non-Hindi speakers. So spill the tea? It's simple — just break it down into three syllables. Sir. Wus. And a subtle "w" sound at the end (the way you'd pronounce the word "were", without the "ere"). **sir-wus-w**~~ere~~. Simple, innit?

### My eyes!! Where's the dark mode??
Ah! Am I even a CS student if my website uses a light theme. LoL. Jokes aside, the theme didn't come with a dark mode and I am working on adding that. Expect it to roll out very soon. 
Hang tight buddy!

### How do I follow and get updates for this website?
The best way to follow and get updates is to subscribe to [RSS Feeds](https://sarvasvarora.me/feed.xml). There are a couple of tools and websites that help you get subscribed, such as [Feeder](https://feeder.co/) and its Google Chrome extension [RSS Feed Reader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rss-feed-reader/pnjaodmkngahhkoihejjehlcdlnohgmp?hl=en), or [Feedly](https://feedly.com/). I sometimes post links to new blog posts and articles on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sarvasvarora) as well, but there is no guarantee for that.

### Where do I find the code related to this website's content?
For small code snippets, they would be included in the website content. For larger projects, please find it on my [GitHub](https://github.com/sarvasvarora).

### I like your website, where can I find the theme?
I'm planning to open source this website as a theme once I'm done adding all the design features I planned and polishing the code (those evil inline CSS looking at me rn +_+).

However, if you are curious, here's a link to the original [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme, and a link to the [initial code](https://github.com/jponttuset/jponttuset.github.io) behind this website.
