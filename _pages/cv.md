## Education

#### McGill University (September 2020 - Present) <br> GPA: 4.0

I am currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree at McGill University as a Computer Science major, along with a minor in Statistics. My current coursework includes Applied Linear Algebra, Probability, Programming languages and Paradigms, Intro to Computer Architecture, and Data Structures and Algorithms.  
I have also participated in a few hackathons such as BOLT McGill Hackathon, and McHacks.

#### Banasthali Public School (April 2018 - March 2020) <br> GPA: 95.6%

I graduated high school from Banasthali Public School as a school topper. Here, I was involved with the CS club, and participated in several olympiads/quizzes and achieved good results in a few.
My senior year research projects were related to analyzing the affect of various bleaching agents on diffenrent types of fabrics; and investigating changes in magnetic behaviour of permanent magnets in extreme tempretures.

## Relevant Work Experience

#### The NYAS Junior Academy (December 2019 - December 2020)

This is a competitive entry program by The New York Academy of Sciences for students of age 13-18 years.
I got to work on a research project along with four other exceptional people. We proposed our solution on creating a smart home focussed on solving current healthcare challenges. The final deliverable is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NNBmqpXMWB0oPy88CR95lGA8QtNET1Fw/view?usp=sharing).  
Being a member, I also had the opportunity to attend several informative talks and workshops conducted by NYAS.

## Honors/Awards

I've won a few awards too. Some of them are:

-   James McGill Prestige scholarship at McGill. This was offered to me for exemplary academic and extracurricular achievement in high school.
-   Full tuition merit scholarships at UT Dallas, Michigan State University, The University of Arizona, and Aalto University (Finland). [Didn't accept]
-   AP Scholar with Honor for scoring 3 or higher in four or more AP exams.
-   Junior Science Talent Search Examination (JSTSE) scholarship from the Government of Delhi. This is offered to the top 100 rankers (~20000 participants). I ranked 27<sup>th</sup>.

## Skills

#### Programming Languages

I often program in Python and Java. I am also familiar with C/C++, JavaScript, shell scripting, git, ~~HTML/CSS~~ and have recently started getting my hands dirty with OCaml.

#### ML stuff

I have always enjoyed learning Math and have so far received formal education in Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus and Probability. Due to this, I've been able to self-learn stuff about machine learning through MOOCs. I mostly use the Tensorflow, Keras and SciKit Learn for ML projects I've indulged in so far. I'm currently exploring sequence models and the field of NLP.

#### Office Suit

I am proficient in writing markdowna and LaTeX, and using productivity apps like Notion.
