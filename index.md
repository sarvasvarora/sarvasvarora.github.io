### About me 

Namaste! I am a first year undergrad at McGill University, studying Computer Science and Statistics.
I was born and brought up in Delhi and would be moving to Montréal for my education very soon (thanks COVID-19 for the year-long delay \_\_/\\\_\_).  
\
My academic interests are mainly in Deep Learning, Functional Programming, and Applied Math. I'm usually looking for ways to apply the stuff I learn and spin it up into something useable. I also like web development (mostly backend) and scripting with Bash or Python. I'm planning to dabble a bit into Economics and Entrepreneurship in the near future.  
\
When I'm not being a nerd, I like to do some casual gaming, binge watch YouTube videos, scroll through memes/xkcd, vibe to my favorite artists' latest releases (HMU for Punjabi song suggestions :p), or just ~~hang out with~~ text my friends. Oh, and I also play recreational Soccer and Badminton.  
\
Feel free to ping me for having convos about CS, life as an international student, all thingz desi (a.k.a. Indian), or pretty much anything else in general!

### Currently

I'm working on a cool project with my friend (more on it soon), trying to fathom the math behind NLP systems, completing assignments ~~on the deadline day~~, applying to internship positions for Summer 2021, and doing...  
\
Crap. I'm just learning how to cook. Thanks mom :")

Big shoutout to [Jordi Pont-Tuset](https://jponttuset.cat); much of the initial code for this website came from his repository, with some major tweaks done by me.
