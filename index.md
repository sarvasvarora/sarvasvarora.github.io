### About me 

Hello, world! I am an SDE at AWS Step Functions, based in Vancouver. I graduated from McGill University, studying Computer Science and Statistics.
\
My academic interests include distributed and large scale systems, cloud computing, applied machine learning, backend software development, and shell scripting.
\
When I'm not grinding deadlines or converting coffee into code, I like to hang out with my friends, bike/walk around the city, play fight with my cat, listen to music, or read.
\
Feel free to ping me for having convos about software engineering, life as an international student, or pretty much anything else in general!

### Currently

Mostly working, and relaxing when I'm done with work. I am also изучаю русский язык (learning Russian language) and exploring my hand at creative writing (see some of my works under ["Deets"](/deets/)). I recently got into photography and do that as a hobby sometimes (see some of my [favorite shots](https://www.amazon.ca/photos/share/K1VrPxmZnyKtOqsBiROPV2PRTCsS5eg52x4XGYCDNYF) so far).

### Contact me

Feel free to get in touch via email or LinkedIn :)

### Credits

If you feel that this website seems (kinda) familiar, then you're not wrong! It's based on the famous [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).

Big shoutout to [Jordi Pont-Tuset](https://jponttuset.cat); much of the initial code for this website came from his repository, with some major tweaks done by me.
