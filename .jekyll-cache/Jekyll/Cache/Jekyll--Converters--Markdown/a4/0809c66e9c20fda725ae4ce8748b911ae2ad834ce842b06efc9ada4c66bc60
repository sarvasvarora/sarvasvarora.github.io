I"z<p>This was a project built at the first ever hackathon I attended (virtually tho). It was organized by BOLT club at McGill in Sept 2020.<br />

Some courses in my first semester,The idea of PathLink came from the fact</p>

<p>In the first ever hackathon that I participated in (organized by BOLT club at McGill in Sept 2020), I built a functional prototype of an ML powered app that automates the process of making groups based on student’s preferences, time-zones, etc.</p>

<p>I feel that professors or TAs end up spending a lot of time in making groups if they do everything manually, or if they randomly do the process, the groups usually become uneven and students don’t enjoy the course.
So, the solution was to kill two birds with a single arrow (SIKE, just figuratively) and make an app that does both, automates the process as well as keep the team/group chemistry as best as it can!
Currently, it’s just designed to work on the data type specifically collected for the project, but in future, I aim to make it scalable and able to fit to more generalized form datasets.</p>
