<h3 id="about-me">About me</h3>

<p>Hello, world! I‚Äôm a third year student at McGill University, studying Computer Science and Statistics. 
<br />
My academic interests include distributed and large scale systems, applied machine learning, parallel computing, backend development, and shell scripting. This semester, I‚Äôm also exploring robotics and learning ROS.
<br />
When I‚Äôm not grinding assignments right before the deadline or converting coffee into code, I like to hang out with my friends, bike/walk around the city, go hiking, listen to music, learn about investing, or occasionally hit the gym.
<br />
Feel free to ping me for having convos about CS, life as an international student, or pretty much anything else in general!</p>

<h3 id="currently">Currently</h3>

<p>Apart from the usual coursework, I‚Äôm involved with the Computer Science Undergrad Society (CSUS) and HackMcGill. I am also trying to learn figure s</p>
