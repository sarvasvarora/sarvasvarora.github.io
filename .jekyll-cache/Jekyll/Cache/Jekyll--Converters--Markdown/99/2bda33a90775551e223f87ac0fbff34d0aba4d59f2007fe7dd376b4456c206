I"Û<p>This was a project built at the first ever hackathon I attended (virtually tho). It was organized by BOLT club at McGill in Sept 2020.<br />
<br />
Some courses in my first semester consisted of formation of groups so that students can collaborate together and have more of an in-class like experience, while being Zoom â€˜24.<br />
I feel that professors and/or TAs end up spending a lot of time in making groups if they do everything manually, or if they randomly do the group-making process, the groups usually become uneven and students donâ€™t end up enjoying the course.
So, the solution was to kill two birds with a single arrow (SIKE, just figuratively) and make an app that does both: automates the process as well as keep the team/group chemistry as best as it can!<br />
<br />
Currently, PathLink just designed to work on the data type specifically collected for the project, but in future, I aim to make it scalable and able to fit to more generalized form datasets.</p>
