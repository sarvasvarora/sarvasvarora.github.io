I"Ş<p>Ok, letâ€™s be frank, youâ€™d probably not be interested in reading this post (I promise more interesting deets soon). So, youâ€™re free to sneak by ğŸ¤«<br />
Iâ€™m writing this more as a form of memoir (more like <em>memeoir</em>) for this website.<br />
<br />
I gave it several thoughts while deciding to make a personal website, if itâ€™d be a good idea that I write too! Turns out it is, and I am so down for it. There are several reasons that lead me to do soâ€¦</p>

<h2 id="enables-me-to-have-a-platform-to-share-what-i-learn">Enables me to have a platform to share what I learn</h2>

<p>This is a pretty obvious thing, and I feel itâ€™s satisfying to do that. Moreover itâ€™s a double kill combo as Sir Feynman said, teaching is the best way to learn things. Presenting my findings in a concise way helps me retain the stuff better, and benefits the potential reader as well.</p>

<h2 id="helps-in-tracking-my-progress">Helps in tracking my progress</h2>

<p>Iâ€™ve always been a believer in the fact that â€œI am my sole competitorâ€ (helps in discarding most of the toxicity that I might perceive otherwise); and in respect for that itâ€™s a fruitful task to keep a log of the stuff Iâ€™m learning over time. In hindsight, Iâ€™d be able to keep track of how much Iâ€™ve improved and make sure to have a conscious thought to not slack off.</p>

<h2 id="keep-a-collectionmemory-of-puns">Keep a collection/memory of puns</h2>

<p>I try to keep my writing as enjoyable as possible, and often end up including puns or fun <em>sic erat scriptumâ€™s</em> as someone else said them while explaining me the concept. This is awesome and catchy, and fun to read later. Well, it also reminds me of the fun aspects of the concepts as opposed to the ones that made the me <del>cry</del> drink even more coffee.</p>

<h2 id="recruiters-please-see-this-">Recruiters, please see this (!!)</h2>

<p>Having gone through the â€¦ itâ€™s very fascinating to explore someone elseâ€™s journey and previous experiences</p>
