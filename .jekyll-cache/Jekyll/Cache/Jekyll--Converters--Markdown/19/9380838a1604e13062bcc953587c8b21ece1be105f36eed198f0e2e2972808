<h3 id="about-me">About me</h3>

<p>Namaste! I am a first year undergrad at McGill University, studying Computer Science and Statistics.
I was born and brought up in Delhi and would be moving to Montr√©al for my education very soon (thanks COVID-19 for the year-long delay __/\__).<br />
<br />
My academic interests are mainly in Deep Learning, Functional Programming, and Applied Math. I‚Äôm usually looking for ways to apply the stuff I learn and spin it up into something useable. I also like web development (mostly backend) and scripting with Bash or Python. I‚Äôm planning to dabble a bit into Economics and Entrepreneurship in the near future.<br />
<br />
When I‚Äôm not being a nerd, I like to do some casual gaming, binge watch YouTube videos, scroll through memes/xkcd, vibe to my favorite artists‚Äô latest releases (HMU for Punjabi song suggestions :p), or just <del>hang out with</del> text my friends. Oh, and I also play recreational Soccer and Badminton.<br />
<br />
Feel free to ping me for having convos about CS, life as an international student, all thingz desi (a.k.a. Indian), or pretty much anything else in general!</p>

<h3 id="currently">Currently</h3>

<p>I‚Äôm working on a cool project with my friend (more on it soon), trying to fathom the math behind NLP systems, completing assignments <del>on the deadline day</del>, applying to internship positions for Summer 2021, and doing‚Ä¶<br />
<br />
Crap. I‚Äôm just learning how to cook. Thanks mom :‚Äù)<br />
