<p>This was a project I did while I was getting started with Machine Learning. <a href="https://codingblocks.com">Coding Blocks</a> had a competition where we had to classify Pokémons based on their names. It’s a multi class classification problem and the Pokémons need to be classified as either Pikachu, Bulbasaur, or Charmander.<br />
<br />
I learned how to implement the <strong>naïve KNN algorithm</strong> from scratch and use the <strong>Numpy</strong> for image processing. The biggest challenge was getting used to working with images as I had never done that before.</p>

<p>These are a few pictures from each category in the dataset provided. I scored an accuracy of over 97% in the final submission.<br />
