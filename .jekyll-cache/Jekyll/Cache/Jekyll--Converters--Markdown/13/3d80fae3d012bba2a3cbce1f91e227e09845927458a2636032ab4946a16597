<p>Aha! I get this question a lot, especially by non-Hindi speakers. So spill the tea? It’s simple — just break it down into three syllables. Sir. Wus. And a subtle “w” sound at the end (the way you’d pronounce the word “were”, without the “ere”). <strong>sir-wus-w</strong><del>ere</del>. Simple, innit?</p>

<h3 id="my-eyes-wheres-the-dark-mode">My eyes!! Where’s the dark mode??</h3>
<p>Ah! Am I even a CS student if my website uses a light theme. LoL. Jokes aside, the theme didn’t come with a dark mode and I am working on adding that. Expect it to roll out very soon. 
Hang tight buddy!</p>

<p>The best way to follow and get updates is to subscribe to <a href="https://sarvasvarora.me/feed.xml">RSS Feeds</a>. There are a couple of tools and websites that help you get subscribed, such as <a href="https://feeder.co/">Feeder</a> and its Google Chrome extension <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rss-feed-reader/pnjaodmkngahhkoihejjehlcdlnohgmp?hl=en">RSS Feed Reader</a>, or <a href="https://feedly.com/">Feedly</a>. I sometimes post links to new blog posts and articles on my <a href="https://twitter.com/sarvasvarora">Twitter</a> as well, but there is no guarantee for that.</p>
