<p>Let’s be frank, you’d probably not be interested in reading this post (I promise to deliver more interesting deets soon). So, you’re free to sneak past this one. 
I’m writing this more as a form of memoir (more like, <em>memeoir</em>) for this website.<br />
<br />
I gave several thoughts while deciding to make a personal website, if it’d be a nice idea that I start writing blogs too! Turns out it is, and I am quite excited about it! There are several reasons that lead me to do so…</p>

<h2 id="provides-me-with-a-micro-platform-to-share-what-i-learn">Provides me with a (micro) platform to share what I learn</h2>

<p>This is a pretty obvious thing, and I feel that it’s quite satisfying to finish writing a blog. Moreover, it’s a <em>double kill</em> as Richard Feynman said that teaching is the best way to learn things. Presenting my findings in a concise format helps me retain the knowledge better, while also benefitting the reader.</p>

<h2 id="helps-in-tracking-my-progress">Helps in tracking my progress</h2>

<p>I believe in the fact that “I am my sole competitor” (helps in discarding most of the toxicity that I might perceive otherwise). In respect for that, it’s a fruitful task to keep a log of the stuff I’m learning over time. In hindsight, I’d be able to keep track of how much I’ve improved and make sure to consciously stay away form slacking off.</p>

<h2 id="keep-a-collectionmemory-of-puns">Keep a collection/memory of puns</h2>

<p>I try to keep my writing as enjoyable as possible, and often end up including puns or fun <em>sic erat scriptum’s</em> as someone else said them while explaining me the concept. I find it awesome to be able to have fun reading my own posts in the future. It would also remind me of the fun aspects of the journey as opposed to the ones that made the me <del>cry</del>, ehh, drink even more coffee.</p>

<h2 id="maintain-an-online-presence">Maintain an online presence</h2>

<p>It’s nice to have an online presence for professional purposes since it gives recruiters a more immersive overview of my profile than just a resume. It also makes networking with people easier because they can now have a look, and possibly relate to my past ventures.
For people who’re not recruiters, but just want to connect regarding school or otherwise, it’s interesting to explore someone else’s journey and the previous experiences as helps in finding a common ground to talk about.<br />
<br />
<br />
And, I think that’s it! It’s a well thought decision and I feel like I’m going to have fun maintaining a blog. Definitely excited to see how this goes. Till then, cya!</p>
