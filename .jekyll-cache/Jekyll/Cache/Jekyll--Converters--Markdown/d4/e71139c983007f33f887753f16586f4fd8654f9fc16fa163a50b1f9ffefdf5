I"ö<p>This was a project built at the first ever hackathon I attended (virtually tho). It was organized by BOLT club at McGill in Sept 2020.<br />
<br />
Some courses in my first semester consisted of formation of groups so that students can collaborate together and have more of an in-class like experience, whiThe idea of PathLink came from the fact</p>

<p>In the first ever hackathon that I participated in (organized by BOLT club at McGill in Sept 2020), I built a functional prototype of an ML powered app that automates the process of making groups based on studentâ€™s preferences, time-zones, etc.</p>

<p>I feel that professors or TAs end up spending a lot of time in making groups if they do everything manually, or if they randomly do the process, the groups usually become uneven and students donâ€™t enjoy the course.
So, the solution was to kill two birds with a single arrow (SIKE, just figuratively) and make an app that does both, automates the process as well as keep the team/group chemistry as best as it can!
Currently, itâ€™s just designed to work on the data type specifically collected for the project, but in future, I aim to make it scalable and able to fit to more generalized form datasets.</p>
