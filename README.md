# Sarvasv Arora's Website

* This site is based on the [Minimal Mistakes](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes) theme, a two-column responsive Jekyll theme perfect for powering your GitHub hosted blog.

* [Jordi Pont-Tuset's site](http://jponttuset.cat/) provided a lot of initial codes to build this site.

* Feel free to download the site and adjust it to your own sites!

* Command to install dependencies: `bundle install`

* Command to start local server: `bundle exec jekyll s --trace`
